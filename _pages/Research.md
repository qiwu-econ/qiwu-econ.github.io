Peer Effects in Product Choice and Market Competition: Evidence from a Mobile Communication Network (Job Market Paper)
<blockquote>
<em>This paper investigates whether and how peer influence in product choices affects product competition and product quality distribution in the Chinese smartphone market. Using a large-scale mobile-call network, I observe variations in peers' smartphone ownership. I exploit the inter-temporal variation in friend circles to construct individual taste controls to partial out unobserved preferences. In addition, I use the partially non-overlapping structure of friends and residential neighbors to construct instrumental variables to identify the causal influence of peers. I find that having one additional friend using a given product leads to a 10 percent increase in the average choice probability. Consumers are more likely to conform to affluent friends and choose products that are distinct in visible features, suggesting that the peer influence is motivated by conformity and status-seeking.  Using a structural demand model, I show that peer effects intensify product competition and favor middle-quality products, while pushing extra-low-quality products to smaller shares.</em>

<blockquote>
<em>We use the universe of de-identified and geocoded cellphone records for over a million individuals from a major Chinese telecommunication provider to examine the role of information exchange in urban labor markets. We find that information flows, as measured by call volume, correlates strongly with worker flows, a pattern that persists at different levels of geographic aggregation. Conditional on information flow, socioeconomic diversity of the social contacts, especially that associated with the working population, helps to predict the worker flows. We supplement the phone records with administrative data on firm attributes and auxiliary data on job postings and residential housing prices. Referred jobs are associated with higher monetary gains, a higher likelihood to transition from part-time to full-time, reduced commuting time, and a higher probability of entering desirable jobs.
Referral information is more valuable for young workers, people switching jobs from suburbs to the inner city, and those changing their industrial sectors. Firms receiving referrals are associated with more successful recruits and faster growth.</em>

Parental Retirement and Adult Children Labor Supply: Evidence From China, funded by <strong>Small Grant in Labor Economics</strong> Cornell University

with Xin Gao, 2020

<blockquote>
<em>Aging and increasing retired population is a global challenge. Previous study suggests that retirement affects economic behaviors of the entire household, including consumption, health outcome, and time use. However, little is known about the intergenerational effects of parental retirement on adult children. This paper studies the effects of parental retirement on adult children's labor supply, both through intergenerational time (care) and monetary transfer. We exploit the mandatory retirement age as the cut-off point and apply a regression discontinuity (RD) approach to China Family Panel Studies. Our findings suggest that parental retirement reduces adult children's annual working hours by 3 to 4 percent, which is primarily driven by females. The reduction in working hours is driven by the lack of formal eldercare provision and parents' increasing demand of time and care from children due to the significant drop in parental self-rated health after retirement. Although adult children tend to increase both monetary and time transfer to parents, we find that parents tend to make disproportional transfers to sons compared to daughters. Daughters are more likely to make transfers to parents after retirement while sons are getting more help and support from sons. Moreover, we provide policy insights on formal care infrastructures, and intra-household gender inequality for countries like China facing increasing aging populations.</em>
