Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Cornell University. My research interests lie in Applied Microeconomics, Empirical Industrial Organization and Social Network Economics. I am currently on the job market and expect to graduate in Spring 2021.

I will be available for interviews at the 2021 ASSA Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA.
